# Marshall Unlearning
A method of spacing out Naive Bayes data across multiple datasets to reduce loading issues. I'm thinking of also including Dynamic Hosting to reduce conflicts between website ports..

Also I marked this as Ruby, but it's more likely to be a mix of Marshall, XML, and Ruby.

## Distributing Data
As part of a continuous research project on storing continuous spaced out data rather than in one large chunk.
