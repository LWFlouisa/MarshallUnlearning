# Marshall Unlearning
A method of spacing out Naive Bayes data across multiple datasets to reduce loading issues. I'm thinking of also including Dynamic Hosting to reduce conflicts between website ports..

Also I marked this as Ruby, but it's more likely to be a mix of Marshall, XML, and Ruby.

## Distributing Data
As part of a continuous research project on storing continuous spaced out data rather than in one large chunk. Research is thanks in partnership with Phind, whom without their home, certain discoveries would not be possible.

[Distributing RSS and Marshall Data](https://lwflouisa.github.io/AskPhind/PhindMeAnAnswer/DistributingSpacedRSSData)

My eventual goal is to way to combine the best of both worlds between distributed file systems, and the benefits of localhosting files.
